Reffect pack for Guild Wars 2. Requires https://github.com/Zerthox/gw2-reffect.

Simple indicators of followup skills and lingering ability effects for weapon/heal/elite slots. Utility skills are not included as those may be placed into any of the 3 available slots. Where applicable a stack counter will also appear over the skill icon.

**Note** that this pack is designed to fit into native UI elements and has been designed for the "Larger" UI size setting. Reffect offers a resize feature for packs that may help fitting it to the other UI sizes.

Zip archive is available under Releases.

This pack does not cover weapon slot 1 skills such as auto-attack chains nor more complex weapon mechanics such as Guardian Illuminated spear skills. For those please see:
